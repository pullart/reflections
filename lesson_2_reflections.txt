1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I'm assuming a baseline is established to create a snapshot of what each file and folder looks like. It'll then be useful for future historical referencing.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
WD can have additional files not lined up for commits. STAG allows us to check in limited, logical entities to the repo.
